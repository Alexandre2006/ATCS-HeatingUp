| Jan 15 | 21:30-22:00 | Really confused by this problem and how to do it efficiently, so I started by modeling it on paper. I think what I'm going to do is label each temperature with the longest chain to get there. Then we loop through all temperatures, find the previous (colder) temperature which has the longest run, and set the new higher temp to the longest runs length + 1. |

I don't think its super efficient, but it does work... |

Super simple to write, but a little bit hard to wrap your head around initially! |
