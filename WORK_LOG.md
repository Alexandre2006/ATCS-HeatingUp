| Jan 15 | 21:30-22:00 | Really confused by this problem and how to do it efficiently, so I started by modeling it on paper. I think that going through each element of the list, and updating all previous (lower) temps is probably the best bet. This way there is never an issue where I accidentally pickup a high value and get stuck. |

I don't think its super efficient, but it does work... |
